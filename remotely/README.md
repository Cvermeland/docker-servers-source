# Remotely

Remotely is a free and open source, self-hosted solution for remote control and remote scripting via a web interface. Linux and Windows is currently supported as client device.

The client interface looks similar to TeamViewer. A nine-digit session ID is displayed, which a registered user can use to connect to the device via the website to control it remotely. The client executable can be downloaded from this hosted instance.
There is also a even more advanced background agent that provide unattended access and remote scripting.

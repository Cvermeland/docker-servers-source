Jackett is a single repository of maintained indexer scraping & translation
logic - removing the burden from other apps. Developer note: The software
implements the Torznab (with hybrid nZEDb / Newznab category numbering) and
TorrentPotato APIs. A third-party Golang SDK for Jackett is available from
webtor-io/go-jackett

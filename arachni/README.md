Arachni is a feature-full, modular, high-performance Ruby framework aimed
towards helping penetration testers and administrators evaluate the security of
modern web applications.

It is versatile enough to cover a great deal of use cases, ranging from a
simple command line scanner utility, to a global high performance grid of
scanners, to a Ruby library allowing for scripted audits, to a multi-user
multi-scan web collaboration platform. In addition, its simple REST API makes
integration a cinch.
